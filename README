# Colony Software

## Remarks

- A lot of documentation and comments are already included in the mathematica notebook.

### List of future improvements

- Fix and test the GUI. Small modifications may be necessary to adapt to the new version of Qt (not much work).
- Implement XML input file support (much more flexible than hard-coded by line text file reading).
