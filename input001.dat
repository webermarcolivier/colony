#Global parameters table. The first dimension correspond to the parameter sets (different simulation runs with different sets of parameter values). The second dimension correspond to the different values of the global parameters at defined time points in the simulation, so that global parameters can change as a step-like function with time at time points defined in the simulation time points table. The third dimension correspond to the global parameters themselves.

#List of initial conditions x0Cell. If initial conditions are changing with the global parameters set, then this is a list of nGlobalPar initial conditions. If the initial conditions are homogenous, then each initial condition is a vector of size nSpecies containing the number of molecules of each species (the same for all the cells). If the initial condition is heterogenous, then the initial condition is composed as follows: an 2D array of size nCells x nSpecies containing the number of molecules of every species in every cell, a vector of size nCells containing the initial phase of every cell.
