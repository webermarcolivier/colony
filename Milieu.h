   * all the other cells in order to calculate the volume of the milieu. However,
   * as the volume of the milieu is much larger than the volume of one cell,
   * there is not much difference.
   * UPDATE 2013.10.17: change this method in order to take into account the volume of
   * ALL the cells and to compute exactly the volume of the milieu. Managed by CellCollection
   * (this is easier since we have to know the volume of ALL the cells).
   * We use a variable milieuVolume_ that we will only update at each time slice,
   * trade-off between accuracy and computation time. Also,
   * volume0 is now constant for the milieu and refers to the inital volume.
